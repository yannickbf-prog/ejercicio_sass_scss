An exercise to practice with Sass and SCSS

## 1.- Sass / SCSS compiler

Do some research (individually or in groups) and find a tool / extension to dynamically parse your Sass or SCSS files into CSS in order to see live the changes in the layout (using Live Server in Vscode, for example)

## 2.- Convert to SCSS

Convert to Sass or SCSS a fraction of the CSS of this repository (itâ€™s a template repository, you can create a copy of it)

1. Variables:   Create some variables and use them inside the file

     - Nest at least 5 selectors an use different levels
     - Nest at least 5 selectors an use different levels

4. Mixins:   Create at least 1 mixin and use it in the CSS
5. Extend:  Write at least 1  inheritable block and use it in the CSS
